Annotation properties
======================

Annotation properties provide text for readers of ontologies to explain the
use of terms.  |IAO|_ defines annotation properties used throughout the VIVO ontologies
for defining terms.  :ref:`Table 5` lists the IAO properties used to annotate terms in the
ontologies.  :ref:`Table 6` lists the terms in the controlled vocabulary for curation
status.  To assert that a term's metadata is complete, the assertion is:

    <term> IAO:0000115 IAO_0000120
    
Alternative terms (IAO_0000118) are not common in the VIVO ontologies.  All other
annotations are expected for all terms.

Non IAO Annotation Properties
-----------------------------

The VIVO ontologies use other annotation properties to describe terms and the ontologies.

``rdfs:label`` is required for all terms and all labels must be unique.  This greatly simplifies
the use of the ontologies -- one can search for the label and unambiguously find the
corresponding term.

``dc:license`` is required for all ontologies.  The license should be CC0 or CC-BY, no
other restrictions are acceptable for use in the VIVO ontologies.

    Property         Label                    Notes
    ===============  =======================  ================================================
    ``rdfs:label``   label                    Every term must have a unique label
    ``dc:license``   ontology license         Every ontology must have a license
    ===============  =======================  ================================================
    

.. We will have a script that can read the ontology and write documentation pages, one per
   property.  The property pages will be listed in a toctree directive generated by the script 
   and included here.  In this way, we make sure all the properties are documented and that
   the document for each is generated automatically from the ontology.
