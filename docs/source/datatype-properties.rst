Datatype Properties
===================

.. include:: tab-all-datatype-properties.txt

.. include:: toc-DatatypeProperty.txt
    
.. We have a script that can read the ontology and write documentation pages, one per
   property.  The property pages will be listed in a toctree directive generated by the 
   script 
   and included here.  In this way, we make sure all the properties are documented and 
   that
   the document for each is generated automatically from the ontology.
