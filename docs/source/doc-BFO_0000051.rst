.. topic:: Alternate name for has part

    has_part

    a core relation that holds between a whole and its part


.. topic:: Definition Source

    None


.. topic:: Example

    my stomach has part my stomach cavity (continuant parthood, material entity has part immaterial entity)


.. topic:: Editor's Note

    Occurrents are not subject to change and so parthood between occurrents holds for all the times that the part exists. Many continuants are subject to change, so parthood between continuants will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
