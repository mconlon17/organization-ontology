.. topic:: Definition Source

    None


.. topic:: Example

    my brain is part of my body (continuant parthood, two material entities)


.. topic:: Editor's Note

    Occurrents are not subject to change and so parthood between occurrents holds for all the times that the part exists. Many continuants are subject to change, so parthood between continuants will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime
