.. topic:: Label

.. topic:: Sub property of

    http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#topObjectProperty

.. topic:: Definition

    A relation between two independent continuants, the target and the location, in which the target is entirely within the location

.. topic:: Example

    this rat is located in this cage

    my brain is located in my head

.. topic:: Editor's note

    Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime

    Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus
