Dates and Times
===============

The Organization Ontology uses the W3C Time Ontology [1]_ for representation of
dates and times.  The key entity is time:Instant, which may have a precision to
indicate whether we know the instant to a particular day, moth, year, or with
more precision, hour, minute, second, and so on.  The Time Ontology has sophisticated
semantics for many kinds of calendars.  The examples for the Organization 
Ontology assume Gregorian calendar.
