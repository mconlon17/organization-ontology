<p class="topic-title">Definition</p>
<p>A relation between two independent continuants, the target and the location, in which the target is entirely within the location</p>

<p class="topic-title">Editorâ€™s note</p>
<p>Most location relations will only hold at certain times, but this is difficult to specify in OWL. See <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime">https://code.google.com/p/obo-relations/wiki/ROAndTime</a></p>
<p>Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus</p>
