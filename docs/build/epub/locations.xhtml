<span id="id1"></span><h1>Locations</h1>
<p>The Organization Ontology represents locations as places on the earth.  The following
entities have locations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>continents</p></li>
<li><p>countries.  Including disputed countries <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id2">1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>regions of countries.  These may have many different names based on the local
jurisdiction, such as territory, state, region, province, or even “kingdom” in the
case of the United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>populated places, which may be cities <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id3">2</a>.  These need not be legally recognized,
merely recognized by people outside the populated place.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="facilities.xhtml"><span class="doc">facilities</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="properties-of-locations">
<h2>Properties of Locations</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>located in.  The Louvre is located in Paris.  Paris is located in France.  Metropolitan
France is located in Europe.</p></li>
<li><p>has geographic representation – a text string of latitude and longitude of (hopefully)
the centroid of the location.  For example, Paris has geographical representation
“48.864716,2.349014”  Note there are no compass designations (E, W, N. S) in the
representation. A negative latitude is south of the equator, a positive latitude is
north of the equator.  A negative longitude is east of the prime meridian,a positive
longitude is west of the prime meridian.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relations-of-locations-to-organizations-and-facilities">
<h2>Relations of Locations to Organizations and Facilities</h2>
<p>Organizations occupy locations.  They are not “located in” locations for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Organizations are not material.  Only material things have locations.  An Organization
such as a chess club may meet in a variety of locations, but they are not located
in a location.  An organization such as Amazon has a presence in many locations.</p></li>
<li><p>“located in” means all of something located wholly within something else.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Organizations occupy locations.  This means they have some legal right to the location
(own, lease, title, other) or they have one or more persons affiliated with the
organization who is at the location (all or some of the time). While
occupation may involve disputes, most do not.</p>
<p>We can then say</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">University</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">Florida</span> <span class="s1">&#39;occupies&#39;</span> <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">University</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">Florida</span> <span class="n">Gainesville</span> <span class="n">campus</span>

<p>Note that ‘located in’ is transitive.  Gainesville is located in Florida.  Florida is
located in the United States.  We can infer that the University of Florida campus is
located in the United States.</p>
