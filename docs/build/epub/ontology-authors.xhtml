<h1>For Ontology Authors</h1>
<p>The Organization Ontology has been developed using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/BFO">Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)</a><span class="link-target"> [http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/BFO]</span> as an upper level ontology,
and in an attempt to follow the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Principles.  Many ontologies have been developed using
this approach.  Many of these ontologies can be found on <a class="reference external" href="http://ontobee.org">Ontobee</a><span class="link-target"> [http://ontobee.org]</span></p>
<div class="section" id="domain">
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>In designing the Organization Ontology, we first conceive of the domain of organizations,
that is we develop a use case for the ontology.  This <em>domain definition</em> guides us
throughout design and implementation, indicating terms that should be included and those
that should be defined elsewhere.  From time to time, terms must be defined to
express important assertions regarding organizations, but have not been defined
elsewhere in a forma that can be used here.  Such terms have a curation status
indicating that we we would prefer if these terms are defined elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reusing-terms">
<h2>Reusing terms</h2>
<p>We are generally cautious to reuse terms from other ontologies.  To reuse terms, we
require the ontology in which they are defined to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use BFO has an upper level ontology.  We have made just a few exceptions and
in each case we have provided a superclass for the term in BFO to create a
consistent and complete subsumption hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Conform to OBO principles. Again, we have made just a few exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>An appropriate license for the ontology whose terms we will reuse.  When a license
for an ontology is not clear, we cannot use its terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Active maintenance.  Ontologies can be slow to add terms and to fix things that
need fixing.  If an ontology is not actively maintained, we cannot use its terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of MIREOT, a plug-in for protege.  When terms from other ontologies
are needed, we use protege to edit <cite>org-header.ttl</cite> and add the the terms using
the MIREOT plug-in.  This provides a consistent means for adding terms.</p></li>
<li><p>We trim out annotation properties of included terms that are not of interest.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-of-templates">
<h2>Use of templates</h2>
<p>All terms defined in the Organization Ontology are created using templates.  There are
templates for classes, annotation properties, datatype properties, object properties,
and named individuals.  In each case, the columns correspond to annotations, class
expressions and other declarations used to create each term.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consistent-build">
<h2>Consistent build</h2>
<p>The ontology file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">org.ttl</span></code> is built using a simple script, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build.sh</span></code>  The script
performs four operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Makes data useful for ontology users.</p></li>
<li><p>Makes ontological assertions from the templates</p></li>
<li><p>Merges org-header and the template assertions into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">org.ttl</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Validates <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">org.ttl</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="validation">
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p>The ontology is validated on each build using <em>robot validate</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>We document the ontology as it is written.  See <cite>For Documentation Authors
&lt;documentation-authors&gt;_</cite>  Documenting as we write the ontology helps with
consistency, accuracy, and completeness.</p>
