<h2>Associations of Organizations with other Organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations can be associated with each other in a variety of manners.  Here we
describe how to represent various associations between organizations.</p>
<div class="section" id="affiliation">
<h3>Affiliation</h3>
<p>An organization can be affiliated with another organization.  In the Organization
Ontology,
affiliation is a broad term and may mean and association that is not further specified.
The only restriction on affiliation is that it is <em>symmetric</em>.  If organization x is
affiliated with organization y, then organization x is affiliated with organization y.</p>
<p>We say simply</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organization</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organization</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">affiliated_with</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>for which we can infer <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id7" id="id2">1</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">affiliated_with</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="structure">
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>Representing organizational structure is a common need.  The Organization Ontology
has two properties, has_organizational_part and organizational_part_of, to specify the
relationship between an organizational part and its parent organization (which may also
be an organizational part).</p>
<p>For example, if x represents Baylor University, and y represents its College of Medicine
we would assert:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">has_organizational_part</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from which we could infer <em>y organizational_part_of x</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id3">2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spin-offs">
<h3>Spin-offs</h3>
<p>Representing organizations that spin-off from other organizations is done
using <em>has spin-off organization” and *spin-off organization off</em> properties.</p>
<p>For example, to represent that y spun-off of x, we would assert:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">spin</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">off_organization_of</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from which we could infer <em>x has_spin-off_organization y</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id4">2</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we want to know more about the nature of the spin-off process, including
dates of various milestones, people who participated, documents involved, and more.
<em>spin-off process</em> is an entity in which other entities may participate, and as an
occurrent, may have one or more <em>spin-off process boundaries</em> as occurent parts. See
<a class="reference internal" href="datetimes.xhtml"><span class="doc">Dates and Times</span></a> for representation of time-based entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="history">
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In some cases, we may wish to assert that organization y is the successor of organization
x, meaning that x has ceased to exist, y now exists, and that the result of the
dissolution
of x was the formation of y.  The inverse of <em>successor_of</em> is <em>has_successor</em>.  We can
say
either <em>y successor_of x</em> or <em>x has_successor y</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id5">2</a>.</p>
<p>We say:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organization</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organization</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">successor_of</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In some cases, we want to know more about the nature of the succession process, including
dates of various milestones, people who participated, documents involved, and more.
<em>succession process</em> is an entity in which other entities may participate, and as an
occurrent, may have one or more <em>succession process boundaries</em> as occurent parts. See
<a class="reference internal" href="datetimes.xhtml"><span class="doc">Dates and Times</span></a> for representation of time-based entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="membership">
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Organizations may be members of other organizations.  If x is a member of y, we can
simple say</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">member_of</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and we can equivalently say <em>y has_member x</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id6">2</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may need to know more about the membership, which is an
asymmetric relationship of two organizations – one organization is the member
and the other organization has granted membership to the member organization.</p>
<p>This is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>.  Since Membership is an occurent, it can have
time-related assertions.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id9">
<span id="figure-4"></span><img alt="General membership pattern  Org 1 -&gt; Member -&gt; Membership -&gt; Grantor - Org 2" src="_images/membership-pattern.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 4.  General membership pattern.  Organization 1 has a member role in a
membership.  Organization 2 has a grantor role in the membership.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To say that v was a member of z through a membership x, we would assert:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">v</span> <span class="n">bearer_of</span> <span class="n">w</span>
<span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organizational_member_role</span>
<span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">realized_in</span> <span class="n">x</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organizational_membership</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">realizes</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organizational_membership_grantor_role</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">inheres_in</span> <span class="n">z</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since each of these properties has an inverse, we could equivalently have asserted:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">z</span> <span class="n">bearer_of</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organizational_membership_grantor_role</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">realized_in</span> <span class="n">z</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">organizational_membership</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">realizes</span> <span class="n">w</span>

<span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">inheres_in</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that this detail is typically only needed in cases where we wanted to say more
about the roles, or membership entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-work-associations-of-organizations-to-occurents">
<h3>Future work – Associations of Organizations to Occurents</h3>
<p>Organizations have associations to occurent such as projects, performances, and
events.  Future ontological work in one or more of these domains should
create the properties and classes needed to represent how organizations
are associated with them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="associations-of-organizations-and-people">
<h2>Associations of Organizations and People</h2>
<p>In a similar manner to the associations between organizations and organizations, we can
associate organizations and people.  And in a similar manner, we can simply
say the organization has an association with a person, or we can use an intermediate
entity and roles to describe how the organization and person are related, providing
detail regarding dates, documents, processes, and participants in the association
between an organization and a person.</p>
<div class="section" id="has-employee-employer-of">
<h3>Has Employee / Employer Of</h3>
<p>To assert a person is an employee of an organization, we can simply say</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">has_employee</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">has_employee</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The entity <em>position</em> is a relationship between a person and an organization.  A person
may one of several roles with respect to the position.  An organization may have
one of several roles with respect to the position.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
