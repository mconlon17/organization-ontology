<h1>Out of Scope Terms</h1>
<p>In designing and building ontologies, one seeks to find a coherent domain for the
ontology – a set of terms that are useful in representing the entities of the domain,
include and reuse terms from other ontologies as appropriate, while not including terms
that belong elsewhere.  These choices are somewhat arbitrary, as long as we have a
cler view of the domain we are attempting to represent, and we are willing to “give away”
terms that we included, but can be reused.</p>
<p>For the Organization Ontology, we adhered as best we could to several guiding principles
regarding terms, domains, inclusion and exclusion.</p>
<p>And, of course, we may have a change of heart regarding any term or set of terms.</p>

<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><a class="reference external" href="locations">Locations</a></p>
<p>It is important for organizations and their facilities to be located on the surface of
the earth.  We found the existing OBI ontologies <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/environmentontology/">ENVO</a><span class="link-target"> [https://sites.google.com/site/environmentontology/]</span> and <a class="reference external" href="http://environmentontology.github.io/gaz/">GAZ</a><span class="link-target"> [http://environmentontology.github.io/gaz/]</span> to have
inconsistencies
and/or complexities that prohibited their reuse.  We created a simple  set of terms
within
the Organization Ontology to define a nested set of locations from continents down
to rooms that can have geographical representations (latitude and longitude) attached
to them.</p>
<p>We would be happy to use terms from another ontology that defines location terms we
could use.</p>
