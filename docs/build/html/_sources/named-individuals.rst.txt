Named Individuals
=================

**Named individuals** are entities which are instances of classes.  A university, a 
continent, a building, a date, and a role in a project are all named individuals.

.. We have a script that can read the ontology and write documentation pages, one per
   named individual.  The named individual pages will be listed in a toctree directive 
   generated by the script 
   and included here.  In this way, we make sure all the named individuales are 
   documented and that
   the document for each is generated automatically from the ontology.
