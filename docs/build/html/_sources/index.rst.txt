The Organization Ontology
=========================================

The Organization Ontology (ORG) is an ontology for 
representing organizations of all kinds.

The Organization Ontology uses |BFO|_ as an upper level ontology, and conforms to 
|OBOP|_ for constructing interoperable ontologies. 

The Organization
Ontology is a one of several ontologies developed for the representation of
scholarship by the `VIVO Project <https://vivoweb.org>`_. The Organization Ontology is 
not limited to the representation of 
scholarship -- it can be used to represent organizations in any setting.

What is an Organization?
------------------------

An organization is a group of people with a purpose. It is not merely a group of 
people -- that would be a collection of people, not an organization. The purpose
may be explicit or implicit. Organizations may be legally constituted or informal.
Organizations may be parts of other organizations.

See :ref:`Organizations <organizations>` for subsumption and subtypes.

Research Organization Registry (ROR) Data
-----------------------------------------

The Organization Ontology is designed to insure it can represent 
the `Research Organization Registry <http://ror.org>`_ data. ROR is a curated, CC0 
collection of facts regarding over 90,000 research organizations in the world. The
Organization Ontology can represent these facts for use in graph-based systems such
as VIVO.

Tools are provided with the Organization Ontology for retrieving ROR data and
creating individuals with assertions as RDF triples using the Organization Ontology.
