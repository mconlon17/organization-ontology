# Organization Ontology

**Early DRAFT**

This is draft work, and effort to create an OBO-compliant, BFO-based, reusable, 
maintained ontology based on data regarding research organizations maintained by 
[ROR](http://ror.org) and pioneered by [GRID](http://grid.ac).

If successful, we hope to register the work as http://obofoundry.org/ontology/org

For background regarding this work, see [Early Thoughts on Representing Organization 
in VIVO](http://bit.ly/2EhMdPq).  The ontology here is intended to be useful to
the [VIVO Project](http://vivoweb.org) but does not depend in any way on VIVO, its
ontologies, nor its software.

The src/ontology/templates directory contains data from ROR used to make templates 
for the OBO robot tool, and named individuals for the ontology.

The src/ontology/i18n directory contains assertions for adding definitions and 
labels in additional languages to the Organization Ontology.

## Versions
