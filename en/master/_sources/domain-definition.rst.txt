Ontology Competency Questions [1]_
-----------------------------------

#. What organizations, in this region, have this interest?  Have this disposition? How 
   can I 
   get in contact with these organizations?
#. What is the organizational chart of this organization?  How many departments does
   this university have?  How many branches does that company have?
#. Which organizations are members of this association?
#. What people have memberships, affiliations, or other roles in which organizations?
#. How can I learn more about this organization?  What is its home page, its Wikipedia
   page?
#. How did this organization come to be and/or come to end?  What documents, people, 
   other organizations were involved in the creation, change, or end of this 
   organization?
#. How is this organization identified in registries of organizations?


Consequences and Observations
-----------------------------

#. Associating scholarly works, outputs, and projects with organizations is beyond the
   scope of this ontology.  Other ontologies represent scholarly works.
#. Similarly, associations of organizations with performances and events are beyond
   the scope of this ontology.  Other ontologies represented performances and
   events.
