To be added

1. Annotation property for cross reference back to VIVO

2. subOrganizationOf / has subOrganization
	when Ontobee is around

3. Add property "interests" with skos:Concept as Range

4. Add properties to specify relationships between organizations
	affiliated with
	member of / has member
	owns / owned by

5. Properties to associate people and organizations

6. Membership modeling

	See Early Thoughts on Roles
	Check VIVO ontology, but likely subsumed
	
7. Position modeling

	See Early Thoughts on roles
	Analogous to membership modeling
	W3C "posts" may be more general, not just employee, but appointee and other.
	
8.  Reports To

	Ah, this is something.  Independent of org chart or postions.  Might
	get complex as W3C simply unions Agent and Post (argh!)
	
9. Qualties of sites (?)

   W3C has primarySite and RegisteredSite (legal)
   
10. Add disjoint property to types of organzations
