.. topic:: Label

    (skos) concept

.. topic:: Definition

    An idea or notion, a unit of thought

.. topic:: Editor's note

    Minor hijack here.  We added the subClassOf assertion to tie in to the BFO subsumption hierarchy rather than adding a new term for 'concept'
    Concept as a generic dependent continuant seems right -- the concept is dependent on the collective of humans.  Thought is in human brains.
    We also edited the label addding (skos) to insure unique labels as required by the OBO Principles. MC.
